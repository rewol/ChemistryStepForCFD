LIST OF PROGRAMS:

main1.cpp:

This is a trial CVODE integrator. No meaningful problem.

main2.cpp:

This is Robertson problem, which is a stiff problem.

main3.cpp:

This is Robertson problem with LAPACK enabled as matrix library.

main4.cpp:

This is Robertson Problem with KLU enabled as matrix library.

main5.cpp:

This is Robertson Problem with KLU but Sparsity indexes are precomputed as well as Jacobian Matrix. This is similar to Jacobian being computed exteriorly
